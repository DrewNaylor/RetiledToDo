# RetiledToDo
The original repo was a Qt5 to-do list app for Windows 10 (UWP). This fork tries to port it to Qt6, bring it more in-line with Metro design, and have it work with Retiled.

A binary version of the original UWP implementation should be available here, but note that IPro Apps is not associated with Drew Naylor and this repo will drift from the original program: https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nwtr19rkfz7

It may take a while to change the branding.
